# Fair Warning
This was my very first project when I started my journey in the programming world. None of the coding conventions+strucuturing+choices should be adopted as good standards by anyone reading the code or using the repo. We were all noobs once...wait I stil am? 

# Mozzie Wipeout

This project was done as part of **Smart India Hackathon(SIH) 2017 Grand Finals**, under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).
This is a pseudo-3D PC game which aims at spreading awareness on prevention of mosquito carried diseases like dengue and chikungunya. The game consists of a simple, user friendly interface and easy to learn visual experience.

## Usage
start by installing python2(if not already present) and then the [pygame 2.7](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library for python2.  

```bash
git clone
cd mozzie-wipeout
python2 mozzie.py
```
